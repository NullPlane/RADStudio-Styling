# Styling for Delphi Editor.
Random collection of my self-mixed graphical styles I use in RAD Studio's Code Editor. Is made for fast copying, as setting it manually or transferring is exhaustingly annoying.

## Formatter
The Formatter Config is as simple to use as it could be.  
`Formatter {-cpp or -delphi here} -config .\NullPlane-EmFormatCFG.config {your File here}`  
I just put it here with the rest of my stuff.

Just remember that the formatter is licensed software which is included in the RAD Studio Package under `.\Studio\{version}\bin\`. Otherwise you may set it up in the formatter preferences directly in the IDE.

## Themes

I wanted to call em somewhat, so I gave them names.  
Please remember, that these are `extracted from BDS 22.0.` If they do not work, you may have to _**replace all the version numbers**_ in the regkeys. :)
